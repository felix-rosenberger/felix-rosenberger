# Hi there 👋
On this profile I'd like to show you some projects I worked on in the past.
Please have a look and feel free to get in touch, if interested! You can reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/felix-rosenberger-1522761b3/).

## 📈 Data Science / Machine Learning
- [Predictive Analytics on NSW Housing Data](https://github.com/felix-rosenberger/NSW-House-Price-Prediction.git)
  - Extensive data cleaning, feature transformation, and analysis of variable relationships
  - Use of different supervised and unsupervised ML algorithms
  - House price predictions and identification of suburbs with high return potential
- [Predictive Analytics for Customer Churn on Telco Data](https://github.com/felix-rosenberger/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/README.md)
  - Feature transformation and selection based on permutation importance and multicollinearity analysis
  - Achieved model sensitivity of approximately 85%, i.e., 85% of actual churners correctly identified 
- [Building a Binary Classifier from Scratch](https://github.com/felix-rosenberger/binary-classifier)
  - Implementation of a binary classifier using logistic regression, a cross-entropy loss function, and gradient descent as a learning algorithm

## 💾 Big Data
- [Big Data Tweet Analysis with MongoDB and Hadoop](https://github.com/felix-rosenberger/Tweet-Text-NLP-with-MapReduce.git) \
  Using Python to connect to a MongoDB instance to extract keywords from tweets, write them back to the DB, and apply MapReduce for counting applications and the MergeSort algorithm.
- [Efficient Big Data Querying with R-Tree](https://github.com/felix-rosenberger/R-Tree) \
  Building an R-Tree index from scratch using Python to then efficiently query a big data set where the performance is compared to a naive query approach.
- [Tweet Analysis using Python and Neo4j (GraphDB)](https://github.com/felix-rosenberger/Assignment-2-Python-and-GraphDB) \
  Building a graph data model using Neo4j which is leveraged to query twitter data.
  
## ⚙️ Data Engineering
- Building an [end-to-end data analytics pipeline](https://github.com/felix-rosenberger/Data-Analytics-Pipeline) on the Google Cloud Platform for SQL queries using BigQuery and Apache Airflow for scheduling.
## 👨‍💻 Data Wrangling
- [Analysis of the Efficacy of Sports Voucher Programs in Australia](https://github.com/felix-rosenberger/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/README.md)
- [Analysis of Cycling Data](https://github.com/felix-rosenberger/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/README.md)
