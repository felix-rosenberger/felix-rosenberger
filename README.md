- [Building a Binary Classifier using First Principles](https://github.com/felix-rosenberger/binary-classifier)
  - Implementation of a binary classifier using logistic regression, a cross-entropy loss function, and gradient descent as a learning algorithm

## ‚öôÔ∏è Data Engineering
- [End-to-End Data Analytics Pipeline](https://github.com/felix-rosenberger/Data-Analytics-Pipeline)
  - Query e-commerce data on the Google Cloud Platform using BigQuery
  - Schedule queries using Apache Airflow

## üíæ Big Data
- [Big Data Tweet Analysis with MongoDB and Hadoop](https://github.com/felix-rosenberger/Tweet-Text-NLP-with-MapReduce.git) \
  Using Python to connect to a MongoDB instance to extract keywords from tweets, write them back to the DB, and apply MapReduce for counting applications and the MergeSort algorithm.

- [Efficient Big Data Querying with R-Tree](https://github.com/felix-rosenberger/R-Tree) \
  Building an R-Tree index from scratch using Python to then efficiently query a big data set where the performance is compared to a naive query approach.

- [Tweet Analysis using Python and Neo4j (GraphDB)](https://github.com/felix-rosenberger/Assignment-2-Python-and-GraphDB) \
  Building a graph data model using Neo4j which is leveraged to query twitter data.
